================================================

This repo is a series of demos from my talk for JupyterCon 2020.

To run this repo: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m jupyter notebook`

The Notebooks here:

**JupyterCon.ipynb** is the main Notebook of the talk, explaining why pydeck was written, how it works, and how to use it.
**Isochrones with GraphHopper and pydeck.ipynb** features a demo of pydeck, Jupyter, and the Graphhopper routing engine working together to count biergartens within 20 minutes of any arbitrary clicked point.
**Tour Map Demo.ipynb** makes the interactive tour map near the end of the talk.
**Synthetic Data Generator.ipynb** makes the user sign-up data you see in the talk.
**San Francisco Business Registrations.ipynb** makes the visualization of San Francisco that opens the talk.
