pydeck: High scale data visualization for Python
================================================

This repo is a series of demos from my talk for JupyterCon 2020.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m jupyter notebook` in this directory run the Notebooks in this repo.

Table of contents:

- **JupyterCon.ipynb** is the main Notebook of the talk, explaining why pydeck was written, how it works, and how to use it.
- **Isochrones with GraphHopper and pydeck.ipynb** features a demo of pydeck, Jupyter, and the Graphhopper routing engine working together to count biergartens within 20 minutes of any arbitrary clicked point.
- **Tour Map Demo.ipynb** makes the interactive tour map near the end of the talk.
- **Synthetic Data Generator.ipynb** makes the user sign-up data you see in the talk.
- **San Francisco Business Registrations.ipynb** makes the visualization of San Francisco that opens the talk.
